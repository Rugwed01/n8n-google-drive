# Troubleshooting Summary

This document outlines the significant challenges and solutions discovered during the development of the WhatsApp Google Drive Assistant workflow. The process was defined by a series of platform-specific bugs and version incompatibilities.

### 1. n8n Version & UI Inconsistencies (v1.114.3)

The user's n8n instance presented a different UI and node set than modern versions, requiring several workarounds:

-   **Problem:** The dedicated `WhatsApp Business Cloud` trigger node was bugged, incorrectly opening an older `WhatsApp Trigger` node that required the wrong authentication.
-   **Solution:** We bypassed this entirely by using the generic **`Webhook`** trigger and a **`Respond to Webhook`** node to manually handle Meta's verification challenge.

-   **Problem:** The `Set` node was not available.
-   **Solution:** Replaced with the more flexible **`Code`** node to parse inputs and set variables using JavaScript.

-   **Problem:** The Google Drive node's simple filters (`Name`, `Mime Type`) were not available.
-   **Solution:** Switched to using the **`Custom Query`** search method, writing raw Google Drive API query strings to find files and folders.

-   **Problem:** The `File: Update` operation for moving files did not have a simple "Move" option.
-   **Solution:** Discovered the correct method for this version was to use the **`Properties`** option and set the `addParents` and `removeParents` keys directly.

### 2. Meta API Connection and Testing

The final and most persistent challenge was initiating a test conversation.

-   **Problem:** After all n8n setup was complete, API calls to send the first message failed with a `(#133010) Account not registered` error, despite the recipient number being verified.

-   **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    1.  Corrected `curl` command syntax for the user's PowerShell environment.
    2.  Confirmed recipient number was verified by deleting and re-adding it.
    3.  Generated a new Permanent Access Token with the correct `whatsapp_business_messaging` and `whatsapp_business_management` permissions.

-   **Final Diagnosis:** After eliminating all user-side configuration errors, we concluded the issue was a persistent, unrecoverable bug in the **Meta Test Number environment** itself.

-   **Final Solution:** The problem was resolved by creating a **brand new Meta App**. This provisioned a new, clean test environment with a new test number, which worked immediately. This confirmed the issue was platform-side with the original test account.
